# Sales Insights of Electronics Shop

I had collected the sales data of an company selling hardware products of various range.

Dataset : [click to download](https://github.com/gauravtopre9/Business-Intelligence-Projectss/blob/main/POWER%20BI/SALES%20INSIGHTS/db_dump.sql)

The dataset given above is in sql format so we have to extract tables from it.
I have extracted the follwing tables.

1. Sales Market
2. Sales Product
3. Sales Transaction
4. Sales Date 
5. Sales Customers

Now there was some relation between these four table which I have defined in POWER BI using star Schema which is as shown below.
