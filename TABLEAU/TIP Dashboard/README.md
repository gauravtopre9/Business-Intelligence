## Project Detail:
TechEdu is an Edutech startup from Raigad Maharashtra and this startup is providing amazing courses and exciting internship opportunities to Undergraduate students from technical and non technical background.

TechEdu is having one special internship campaign names TECHEDU"S INTERNSHIP PROGRAM where company have launched internships on task basis i.e when a student enroll to this program he will be assigned with a list of task and after completing this list of task he/she will be awarded with a completing certificate.

But suddenly a stakeholder of techedu noticed huge difference between number of candidates who are applying for this internship program to number of students completing this program so they hired me as a data analyst and now its my task to provide them with the detailed insights about their Internship program.

Now I am going a step ahead in this project with following AIMS Grid.

#### AIMS GRID
**1. Purpose :**
To unlock the hidden insights of free unpaid internship program by an edutech startup and so help them for focusing in weak areas.

Insights of Marketting methods in future based on past.
Insights on bringing change in data collection techniques.
Domains leads able to take decisions on variation in difficulty level of tasks for their respective domains.
